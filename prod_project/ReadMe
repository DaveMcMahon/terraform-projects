Terraform project which creates two Public subnets and two Private subnets within a VPC and launches an ec2 instance with an EBS volume attached, formatted and mounted.

Within the public subnets, I launch an ec2 instance which picks up a public facing IP via the map_public_ip_on_launch field.
The VPC has an internet gateway configured for access to the internet.
A route table exists to point all internal traffic to the internet gateway, and a route table association exists for the public subnets. Could possibly create a route table entry and association for the private subnets and point them at a NAT gateway.
The instance also has an EBS volume created within the same AZ, and attached to the above instance.
The EBS volume is formatted and mounted to /data with a record inside the fstab config file.
The private subnets do not get a public IP and have no access to the outside world. Could possibly create a NAT gateway and point it towards the main public Internet gateway, or via a central update server.
The instance has user data passed configured via a cloudinit template file, rendering two scripts i.e. shell script and init.cfg, the former for EBS volume admin and the latter for OS update, upgrade and software download.
Ignore files are in place for the terraform state files, which uses S3 as the backend anyway but is good practice.
Ignore file in place for terraform.tfvars which holds the aws access/secret keys.
